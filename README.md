# **Radio Frequency Remote-control Rover**
This project describes the building process of the Remote-Controlled Rover for lifting and transporting objects. 

It is an Arduino powered rover enabled with a hydraulic lift to carry and deliver objects in work environments. It is purely controlled by a remote control device operating with Radio Frequency to communicate.
